This is a calculator project completed for The Odin Project. Inspiration was taken from the youtube video (https://youtu.be/aKaId56512U). Modified to prevent certain methods of breaking. The calculator uses the eval function to do the math.

-Accepts only one decimal point per string
-Added keyboard support
-Made input field read-only
-Functions were heavily modified to make the calculator more normal (only 1 decimal, doesn't allow carryover of old data, etc)

Bugs: 
-Pressing enter without a complete problem will reset the calculator but not show this to the user

Attempted to create a backspace button using string slice method to modify field.value. Did not work. May fix at a later date.
